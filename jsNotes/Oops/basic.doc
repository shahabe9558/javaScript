    Que-1: What is Object...?
    Ans: An object is a unique entity which contains property and method.
    For example “a car” is a real-life Object, which has some characteristics like
    color, type, model, and horsepower and performs certain actions like driving. 
    The characteristics of an Object are called Properties in Object-Oriented
    Programming and the actions are called methods. An Object is an instance of a 
    class. Objects are everywhere in JavaScript, almost every element is an Object 
    whether it is a function, array, or string.  
    A Method in javascript is a property of an object whose value is a function.
